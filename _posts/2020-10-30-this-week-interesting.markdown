AirCon. Damaged brand new TV. Learning ExpressJS.

### AirCon.
Yes, so me and the wife decides to replace our old Air Conditioner with [new one](https://www.lg.com/id/split-air-conditioning/lg-S10EV4) and decided to install it ~~myself~~ with the help from the folks and little bro.

Few things I learned in the process :
- **Location, location, location**. This might be an honest mistake, so there's 2 location to place the outdoor unit. 2nd floor (cons: oil inside the outdoor compressor could gone down to the indoor, shortens life. pros: better airflow for cooling ) or small yard right beside the bedroom ( cons : noticed it very late. it is a tight space. so the heat generated by the outdoor unit doesn't escape the room properly == bad outdoor cooling == bad indoor cooling. pros: easier maintenance ).
  
- **Yes, people do slack on the job**. We noticed it when dismouting the old AC, It seems the technician decides to hammer the Indoor bracket to the wall when installed it. Took almost an hour to jimmy it up. 

- **Water drain pathway**. Make sure you do plan the pathway properly, cut the excess hose, DO NOT LEFT IT ROLLED UP outside or you will have the bedroom with a chance of light raining with no wind :facepalm:

It's been a week since the new AirCon installed and I think we'll move the outdoor unit to the 2nd floor for better outdoor / indoor cooling sometime later. It does cool the bedroom but not to the cooling that I expected.

### Damaged brand-new TV.
I decide to buy an Android TV ( It's local brand in Indonesia, I think) from an e-commerce an have it send to our place instantly ( within 3 hours ) while we're working on installing the new AirCon. Well the TV does come within 3 hours, and in the evening, I'd deliver it to the folks place by car. Everthing is all good and well until we unbox the TV packaging and we notice the lcd screen already breaks. Damn. I submited an insurance claim but still pending review for approval.

### Learning ExpressJS.
So when I decide to take a leave for a week, I'd plan to do some learning on programming for myself. I decide to learn javascript, but I tend to hurry things so i skipped the basic and straight to learning ExpressJS. I even create the [repository](https://github.com/dimazyuwono/js-finance-tracker) for the application I'm currently working on.

I decide to look for some real-world problems on my day to day activities and I come up with an idea to create an application that tracks our finance. Yes, there's already ton of it, but I'd still work on this as it's a good learning project. Learning by doing, they say. though it less effective than procrastinate :hehehehe:.
